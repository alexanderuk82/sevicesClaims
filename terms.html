					invalidate the product or service provided by the third party. We do
					not accept any responsibility or liability for any loss or damage you
					may suffer or incur if any information, content, material or data held
					by the third party about you is not correct, complete and accurate or
					if it is misleading or if you have failed to disclose all relevant
					facts.
